It's been a while since my last post. I'll try to do my future self a favor and write more moving forward.

In recent months I've been brainstorming this idea for a platform that would aim to solve issues with communication online. A former colleague and Product Manager recently shared their perspective on communication in remote settings and to borrow some of what I said there:

> There are underutilized features of digital communication that I think need to be framed differently to feel more natural. We have more control over reducing friction in group communication in a virtual environment than we do in the real world, but I don't know if anyone has focused on that in this context.

In addition to that, there are much more dynamic ways of conveying information and a lot of ways we can use AI to assist. I'm looking forward to building, testing, and writing about this more throughout the year.

And to wrap up this New Year post, I'll list some things I hope to achieve this year:

- Buy a house
- Spend a lot more time with family
- Be more vocal and more social
- Stress less, exercise more, develop a better routine, practice meditation, be healthier than I am today
- Gain a much better understanding of mathematics and physics than I have now
- Read most of the books on my shelf
- Get back to playing with music
- Launch a startup
- Establish a local third place (stretch)
