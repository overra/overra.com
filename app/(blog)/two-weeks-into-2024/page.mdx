Overall personal progress seems to be going well this year.

- In the process of buying a home and starting initial renovations next month.
- Spending more time with family, but will be even more consistent after moving into the house.
- I've been more social and vocal, but this definitely needs more attention.
- Working on the habit of regular periods walking on treadmill at standing desk.
- I'm 25 days into learning Math & Physics through Brilliant. I love it.
- I haven't picked a book yet but will read at least one this month.
- Starting daily Melodics courses for Ableton Push & Keyboard.
- Began the process of forming a company with Stripe Atlas.

In addition to Math & Physics, I've picked back up learning Chinese (primarily), Spanish, and Turkish on Duolingo and 14 days down so far. Last time I practiced learning Chinese was early 2020 and I was surprised how much I retained.

Furthermore, I've made better practice of taking notes and organizing my thoughts externally. I've never really practiced note taking regularly before, which is a shame. Here's to a better future.

## lil Media, Inc.

This weekend, to keep the momentum going this month, I got the formation process started for lil Media. There's a ton of work ahead and I'm excited to officially kick this off.

The upcoming projects, which I'll cover further in a future post, are focused on communication, creation, and curiosity, as well as battling the [enshittifcation of the web](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rimtaSgGz_4).
